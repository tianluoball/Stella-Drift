Leap Motion Dodge Game
A simple dodge game using Leap Motion and Unity. Players use their right hand as a spaceship, performing rolls, movements and other operations.
Players must avoid incoming objects or make a fist to shoot bullets to destroy these objects. The longer the survival time, the higher the score. The game will become increasingly difficult over time.
